We meet Tuesdays, 10am.\r\n\r\n### Talks\r\n\r\nCurrently we've had one presentation. You can view the Jupyter notebook at the provided link. As other talks happen we'll (hopefully) upload the notes/notebooks for reference.\r\n\r\n#### Next Talk\r\n  * November 22\r\n\r\n#### Previous Talks\r\n  * November 11: [Introduction to Restricted Boltzmann Machines](https://github.com/HardtimesMachineLearningJournalClub/Meeting1-RBMs), Katie Hyatt\r\n\r\n### Worth Reading\r\n\r\n#### Condensed matter physics with machine learning\r\n  * [Learning Thermodynamics with Boltzmann Machines](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02718)\r\n  * [Machine learning quantum phases of matter beyond the fermion sign problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07848)\r\n  * [Machine Learning Phases of Strongly Correlated Fermions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02552)\r\n  * [Self-Learning Monte Carlo Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03137)\r\n  * [Accelerate Monte Carlo Simulations with Restricted Boltzmann Machines](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02746)\r\n\r\n#### General Machine Learning\r\n  * [A Practical Guide to Training Restricted Boltzmann Machines (PDF)](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/guideTR.pdf)\r\n  * [A Beginner's Tutorial for Restricted Boltzmann Machines](https://deeplearning4j.org/restrictedboltzmannmachine)\r\n  * [A Beginner's Guide to Understanding Convolutional Neural Networks](https://adeshpande3.github.io/adeshpande3.github.io/A-Beginner's-Guide-To-Understanding-Convolutional-Neural-Networks/) (the whole series is worth reading!)\r\n  * [Convolutional Neural Networks](http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/) Stanford CS introduction to CNNs for image recognition.\r\n  * [An Intuitive Explanation of Convolutional Neural Networks](https://ujjwalkarn.me/2016/08/11/intuitive-explanation-convnets/)",
